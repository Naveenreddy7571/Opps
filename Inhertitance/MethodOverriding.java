 * What is Method Overriding
* Whenever a child class contains a method with the same prototype as the parent class, then we say that the method of child class has OVERRIDDEN the method of parent class
 *          
 * 
 *  Method Overriding V/s Method Overloading
    
    Method Overloading
    Method Overriding
    â†’ Overloading can be done either within the same or between methods of PARENT
    & CHILD class
    Overriding can never be done within a single class and it always requires INHERITANCE i.e overriding can be done between between of PARENT & CHILD only

    => Overloading says methods must have same, but COMPULSORILY different arguments
    => Overriding says methods MUST COMPULSORILY have exactly same prototype. Although overriding allows CO-VARIANT return types
 * 
 * 
 *          covarient return type: we can change the return type in method overriding only if it is a subclass of parent class method return type

    BB is subclass of AA so we can change the return type this is called covariance return type
